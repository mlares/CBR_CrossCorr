Team work  
=========

- Organizar códigos.   Tratar de armar un solo repositorio, e ir
  poniendo los códigos "limpios" en *src*


Development
===========

- Complete documentation: it is generated automatically from
  metacomments, using Sphinx.

- Complete tests

  Make several tests to reach a good code coverage and verify
  if results are as expected.

  Examples:

  * read a synthetic map and verify a flat profile.
  * Check if CMB maps are read correctly
  * Check paths and files
  * read a sample of random centers and compute an averaged flat profile
  * compute the profile of just one center (fixed?)
  * checl size of CMB map and Nside
  * compare results of serial and parallel versions.

  Asserts:

  * What to do is data files are missing
  * Prevent variable overflows and division by zero
